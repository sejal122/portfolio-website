				<p style="font-size:1.5vw;" id="para3"><br>When covid-19 hit us somewhere arround march 2020 I was in my final year of  BE.Honestly i enjoied that quarantine period like never before,with a slight feeling of missing the outside world.<br>Like everyone else a lot of things changed in that quarantine period.I enjoied approx 4 months without doing anything productive,Besides painting and working on my final year project a little bit.I would also like to mention that I am a small artist with te love for oil paints,water colors,soft pastels and what not.<br><br>Then after a few months reality started to hit me hard.I felt like i had completely forgotten about my carrier.That's when i started applying to various jobs.Literally every job i woul come accross.But it had become extremely difficult to find a job that doesnt require any experience.I had zero experience btw.But i had no doubt about my coding skills.<br>Here i would love to acknowledge how one non-paid internship changed the direction of my carrier.<br><br>I did a small internship in python for a month and worked on the modules they assigned me.When i started mentioning that 1 months experience on my CV,job hunting sites I could see a little hope and felt i could get a job now.Even that 1 month internship helped me boost my confidence and the recuriters intrest too.<br><br>That time the advertisements of the Ed tech company WHITEHAT JR. were all over the internet , social media etc.I keept seeing them,skipping them but never occured to me that i could apply to this job.One day my mother suggested i should give it a try.I filled their form , applied for being an online coding tutor.Waited a few weeks but there was no response.I thought it was an dead end there.Then i came to know one of my college friend has applied after me and was shortlisted and was about to give the second round of the interview.<br>This alarmed me,thought to myself if we have the same qualifications how come she was able to crack in.I applied the second time for the same job in WHITEHAT JR. After inquiery i found out there was some technical erroe in my first applicaton from there side so it was not being processed. I was shortlisted from that second application of mine.As days passed i went on clearing every round and before i could know i was selected and there was a selection letter and contract in my hand.<br>I am happy to say i grabbed that opportunity and now its been 7 months since i work as a coding tutor. </p>
